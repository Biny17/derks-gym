'''
1/ Define the neural network architecture:
- Create a TensorFlow model using the tf.keras API.
- Define the input layer based on the state observations.
- Add one or more hidden layers with appropriate activation functions.
- Add the output layer based on the action space of the environment. For example, use a softmax activation for discrete action spaces or a linear activation for continuous action spaces.
- Instantiate the model and define the necessary placeholders or input tensors for later use.

2/ Implement the PPO algorithm:
- Define hyperparameters: Set values for hyperparameters like learning rate, discount factor (gamma), value function coefficient (vf_coef), entropy coefficient (ent_coef), etc.
- Initialize variables: Create TensorFlow variables for the policy network weights and other necessary variables.
- Collect data: Interact with the environment using the current policy and collect trajectories (state, action, reward, next_state, done) from multiple episodes.
- Compute advantages: Use the collected trajectories to estimate advantages using techniques like generalized advantage estimation (GAE).
- Define the loss functions:Policy loss: Calculate the surrogate objective function, which measures the policy improvement compared to the old policy.
- Value function loss: Calculate the loss that compares the predicted value function to the estimated returns.
- Entropy loss: Encourage exploration by penalizing low entropy in the action distribution.
-Compute the total loss as a combination of the policy loss, value function loss, and entropy loss, using the hyperparameters to weight their contributions.
- Define the optimizer: Create an optimizer object (e.g., AdamOptimizer) to minimize the total loss.
- Compute gradients and update weights: Use TensorFlow’s automatic differentiation to compute gradients of the total loss with respect to the model’s trainable variables, and apply the gradients to update the model’s weights.

3/ Train the model:
- Iterate over a certain number of training epochs or episodes.
- Within each epoch/episode:Collect new data by interacting with the environment using the current policy.
- Compute advantages using the collected data.
- Optimize the model by minimizing the total loss using the optimizer and the collected data.
- Optionally, you can include additional steps such as monitoring the training progress, logging important metrics, or saving checkpoints of the model.
- Remember to consult TensorFlow’s documentation for specific implementation details and to adapt the structure to your specific problem domain.'''
